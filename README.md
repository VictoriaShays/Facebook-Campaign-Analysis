# Facebook-Campaign-Analysis

In this project I explored data from a Facebook marketing campaign dataset. I performed my analysis in PowerBI using DAX measures and Power Query Editor to create an operational dashboard. Using PowerBI, I was able to clean and transorm the data, without using Excel.

The original dataset only contained years 2018-2019. To update the information with 2020 data, I used the APPEND function to stack the two datasets.
